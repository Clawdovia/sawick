    <p>Building AI autonomous cognitive layers — three machines, each doing one job, modeled on how the biological brain works.</p>
    <p>Every step of the build is documented here as it happens. The decisions, the architecture, what works, what doesn't.</p>
    <p>All of it lands on <a href="https://github.com/Clawdovia">GitHub</a> for you to fork and adapt for your own setup.</p>
    <p>Building from cafés on the Mediterranean. Earning in dollars. Living where it's beautiful.</p>
